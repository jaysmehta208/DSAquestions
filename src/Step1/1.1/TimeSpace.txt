Space Complexity:
 - Auxiliary Space: Space taken to solve the problem
 - Input Space: Space taken to store the input

In competitive programming, platforms take 
 - 1 second for 10^8 operations (So code should be O(10^18))
 - 2 seconds for 2 * 10^8 operations 
Imp point: Never do anything to the input to save space
