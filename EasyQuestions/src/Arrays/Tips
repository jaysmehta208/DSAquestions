1) Think about reversing array to play with numbers
2) Also use the sum of all numbers in array if useful
3) Two pointer approach just has another index iterator (including the for loop index iterator of array) based on a
condition
4)  - XOR of two numbers.... XOR of identical numbers is 0,  XOR with one number 0 = other number... e.g 2 ^ 3 = 1
    - XOR of all natural numbers is less than sum of all natural numbers (less space taken)
5) If algorithm is based on division of N by some number, then the time complexity will be logarithmic
